## üî• Update
- [2024.10.16] Code for GaussianVolume Fitting is released ! See [CPS](https://github.com/sotamak1r/CPS) !
- [2024.07.04] Code and Models for text-conditional 3D generation are released !
- [2024.07.04] GVGEN was accepted by ECCV 2024. See you in Milan!

## üåø Introduction

We introduce GVGEN, a novel diffusion-based framework, which is designed to efficiently generate 3D Gaussian representations from text input. We propose two innovative techniques: 
- ``Structured Volumetric Representation``. We first arrange disorganized 3D Gaussian points as a structured form GaussianVolume. This transformation allows the capture of intricate texture details within a volume composed of a fixed number of Gaussians. 
- ``Coarse-to-fine Generation Pipeline``. To simplify the generation of GaussianVolume and empower the model to generate instances with detailed 3D geometry, we propose a coarse-to-fine pipeline. It initially constructs a basic geometric structure, followed by the prediction of complete Gaussian attributes. 


## ü¶Ñ Text-conditional 3D generation

### Environment Setup

```bash
conda create -n gvgen python=3.8
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, install the `diff-gaussian-rasterization` submodule according to the instructions provided by [3DGS](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting)


### Pretrained Models
Please download models from [![Hugging Face Spaces](https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%A4%97%20Hugging%20Face-Models-blue)](https://huggingface.co/SOTAMak1r/GVGEN), put them in the folder `./ckpts`.



### Run

After completing all the above instructions, run 

```bash
python run_text.py --text_input YOUR_TEXT_INPUT

# for example
python run_text.py --text_input "a green truck"
```

The generated gif and 3DGS will be saved to `sample.gif` and `sample.ply`, respectively.
The text condition we used during training is derived from [Cap3D](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tiange/Cap3D). 
We recommend everyone to imitate the style of Cap3D's text and create your own prompts for better generation results.
